			<p>It has been a while. As it turns out, minor league life is much busier than I remember from last year. My last entry was about 3 months ago! Where did the time go?!</p>
<p>I will give you an update on the season thus far and maybe provide a little preview of some big things coming up soon. Thank you all for being patient with me.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Season Update</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe it is already July. Time just seems to fly by when you are in minor league baseball. Has anyone seen the movie Groundhog Day? I think minor league baseball is similar in a lot of ways. It seems like I wake up at the same time every day, eat the same meals, arrive at the field at the same time, do the same thing every day, head home and finally go to bed to do it all again. Now, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to say all days are always the same. There are definitely variety and excitement in each day, but in general, baseball players do just about the same thing every day. Maybe that is why we are all considered creatures of habit, routine-oriented, or even superstitious.</p>
<p>My season started in Corpus Christi, TX, the home of the Hooks. I am proud to have represented the people of Corpus Christi during my time there. They are hard workers, passionate and very loving. They welcomed our team with open arms and invested in us, supporting us amidst winning streaks, losing streaks (which fortunately didn&#8217;t happen too often), rain and sunshine, and air so thick you can taste it (thanks, humidity)! Needless to say, I am very grateful for the way I was treated during my stint in Corpus.</p>
<p>The Texas League is a fun league to play in. It gives you a good taste of what the big leagues will be like (so I hear). The travel can be tough, as we bus everywhere in the league, the longest trips being about 14 hours away. But all in all, it is a great league. One of the benefits of the league is that there are only 8 teams. So we end up playing teams over and over again. It gives us opportunities to face a team, and even if we don&#8217;t do well, we know that we will have a chance to redeem ourselves very soon. Baseball is a game of adjustments, and when things don&#8217;t turn out the way you want, you make adjustments to get it right. And the beautiful thing is that the other team makes adjustments too. It is a game of repeated trial and error, doing your best to win every step of the way.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_111" style="width: 579px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="  wp-image-111" src="https://firstroundreflections.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/mg_9987_1.jpg?w=579&#038;h=386" alt="MG_9987_1" width="579" height="386" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Whataburger Field on Fireworks Night, Corpus Christi, TX</p></div>
<p>But as great as the league is, and as great as the people in Corpus Christi are, and as beautiful of a setting as Whataburger Field is, (and as delicious as the Whataburger honey butter chicken biscuit is&#8230;), the thing I loved most about Corpus was my team. The guys that we have in the Astros organization are quality men. Every one of them is different and I could share unique things about each person that makes them special, but that would take way too long. All in all, my experiences so far in baseball have only been as good as the people that surround me. And I pray that I am a teammate that lifts others up and makes their experiences more enjoyable as well.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will share about one of my teammates. My roommate-on-the-road while I was in Corpus was a fellow by the name of Lance McCullers Jr. Most people probably don&#8217;t know who he is, though. (Just joking!! If you don&#8217;t know about Lance, you are missing out on one of the most exciting pitchers in the game! The kid is a stud!) We have played together ever since I joined the Astros organization in 2013 and we immediately became great friends. He is someone who cares deeply about his teammates, has a great approach to the game and has been blessed by God with incredible, incredible talent. I am so proud of him and how he has pitched this year.</p>
<p>But as many of you know, when guys like Lance do what things like Lance did in AA, they get promoted, and after about 5 weeks of the season, Lance was gone to bigger and better things! The fact that we are in separate places doesn&#8217;t change our friendship. And he hasn&#8217;t big leagued me yet (&#8220;yet&#8221; being the key word).</p>
<p>This relationship between me and Lance is something that happens all over baseball. Guys come and go. You develop friendships while you are together, and then support and root for each other when one goes on to the next level. At least that is the way I think it should happen. Lance and I text all the time about his games, my games and just life in general. I&#8217;ve heard stories about teammates being bitter and frustrated when other guys get their chance at the next level before them, but I have not experienced it with the Astros. The culture the coaches and players here have created is a good one, and I think a lot of people in the baseball world are starting to see the fruits of supporting each other rather than tearing each other down. Plus it made it much more enjoyable when I was called into my manager&#8217;s office and told I would be promoted to the AAA team, Fresno.</p>
<p>When we get promoted, it is a very strange process. We are usually told about it right after a game and given a flight itinerary for the next morning to travel to wherever the new team may be. That means we have to pack our entire lockers up, pack up everything we have wherever we are living, and condense it all to 2-3 bags. While we are playing during the season, we are minimalists. Most guys only have clothes for one week, maybe two. One travel suitcase. One baseball bag. One backpack. That&#8217;s about it for 6 months out of the year. Not glamorous by any means.</p>
<p>So I packed up my locker, said my goodbyes, hopped in my car and drove to my host home. My host dad, Greg Blankenship, who I have become very close friends with during my time in Corpus, helped me pack up all my possessions and load up my truck before going to bed for a few hours before waking up and driving me to the airport. Greg is also the team chaplain in Corpus and is someone I look up to in my own life. He is fun to be around, yet passionate about his relationship with Jesus and sharing his faith through love and building relationships with others. His family is beautiful and they have loved me much more than I deserve to be loved. I&#8217;m truly grateful for people like Greg and the Blankenship family. Greg&#8217;s the guy who makes a 4:45 AM drive to the airport very enjoyable.</p>
<p>Airports are not my favorite places, especially early in the morning. I just want to sleep, but I am always scared of missing my flight if I fall asleep at the airport (which has definitely happened to me before). And unfortunately there are not too many direct flights from Corpus Christi, TX to Fresno, CA (if you know of any, please let the Astros travel secretary know!!). I flew from Corpus to Houston, Houston to Denver, and Denver to Fresno, changing planes in Houston and Denver; it was a long day.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in AAA, you notice a few differences. The stadiums are a little bit bigger, the talent is a little bit more consistent, and the travel days are a lot longer. It&#8217;s been almost two weeks since I&#8217;ve arrived and I feel like I am fitting in well, working hard to prepare myself for my starts to help the team win. And as much fun as that is, I am most excited about the people here and building or continuing relationships with my teammates. The future is bright and exciting.</p>
<p><strong>  </strong></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next?</strong></p>
<p>The next few months are going to be so much fun! My greatest desire is to be a part of the Houston Astros and really be a contributing piece of the team down the stretch and heading into the playoffs. In the meantime, our All Star break is coming up in about a week. The All Star break is a great chance for most players to go home, see friends and family, and get away from the game a little bit. I, though, will not be going home for the entire time. I&#8217;ve been blessed with the opportunity of playing in the Futures Game on July 12 in Cincinatti during the MLB All Star Week. And the best part about it is my family will be able to join me in Cincinatti to celebrate God&#8217;s blessings of amazing experiences and opportunities! So if you&#8217;re in Cincy or are able to watch the Futures Game, definitely keep an eye out for me! I&#8217;m so excited!</p>

<p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>
<p>Thank you those of you who left questions back in spring training, they have not gone unnoticed and a new post with answers to questions will be up soon. If you have any more questions about baseball, this season, or my life in general, please leave them in the comments and I will do my best to answer in the next post. God bless!</p>
