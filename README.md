Twitter Visualizer

A data visualizer for Twitter, based on the location of the most recent tweets that have geolocation information. 
Used the Twitter framework to get the most recent tweets within a 1-mile radius of the userâ€™s current location and display it on a map. The app continuously polls for new tweets, and display them on the map when they are received. Once 100 pins have been placed on the map, the 10 oldest tweets are removed. If the user taps on one of the pins, a small view should display some information about the tweet.
